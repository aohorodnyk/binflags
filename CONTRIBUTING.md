# How To Contribute
We like to encourage you to contribute to the repository.
This should be as easy as possible for you but there are a few things to consider when contributing.
The following guidelines for contribution should be followed if you want to submit an issue, or a pull request.

## Code Of Conduct
All discussion inside the project (issues, PRs, etc.) have to follow [Code Of Conduct](https://github.com/aohorodnyk/gobitflags/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Questions
If you have any question, you should use [issue ticket](https://github.com/aohorodnyk/gobitflags/issues) as well as for issues/feature requests.
Do not hesitate to use [issue ticket](https://github.com/aohorodnyk/gobitflags/issues) for all your needs.

## How To Prepare
* You need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join)
* Submit an [issue ticket](https://github.com/aohorodnyk/gobitflags/issues) for your issue, or question if there is no one yet
	* Describe the issue and include steps to reproduce if it's a bug
	* Ensure to mention the earliest version that you know is affected
* If you are able and want to fix this, fork the repository on GitHub
	* If fix is small you can just [create a pull request](https://github.com/aohorodnyk/gobitflags/pulls) with your changes
	* If you want to do some changes in API or request big feature, submit an ticket before [issue ticket](https://github.com/aohorodnyk/gobitflags/issues) to save your time

## Make Changes
* In your forked repository, create a topic branch for your upcoming patch. (e.g. `feature-autoplay` or `bugfix-ios-crash`)
	* Usually this is based on the `main` branch
	* Create a branch based on `main`
	* Please avoid working directly in the `main` branch directly
* Make sure you stick to the coding style that is used already
* Make commits of logical units and describe them properly
* Check for unnecessary whitespace and code with `git diff --check` before committing
* If possible, submit tests to your patch/feature, so it can be tested easily
* Assure nothing is broken by running all the tests and your manual tests

## Submit Changes
* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository
* Open a pull request to the original repository and choose the right original branch you want to patch
* If not done in commit messages (which you really should do) please reference and update your issue with the code changes, _please do not close the issue yourself_
* Even if you have write access to the repository, do not directly push or merge pull-requests. Let another team member review your pull request and approve it
